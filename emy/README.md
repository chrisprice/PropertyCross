#Emy

Visit the [Emy page](http://propertycross.com/emy/) on the PropertyCross website for screenshots and code sharing metrics.

##Overview

[Emy](http://www.emy-library.org/) is a lightweight library for building cross-platform mobile application using HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. It is shown here with its own theme, but has [themes](http://www.emy-library.org/plugins.html) available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

Emy is free and open sourced under an MIT licence.

The Emy version of PropertyCross uses [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) in order to create the native packages.

##Building The Application

Applications developed with Emy can be run directly within a web browser. Because the application uses XHR in order to load templates, if you run the application from your local file system you will encounter problems due to the [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy). You can solve this either by serving the app from a web server, or by using one of the [Chrome switches](http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/) that disables this policy.

The Emy application is packaged using [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/) - see [`/phonegap/README.md`](https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross/tree/master/phonegap) for details.
